> **Empowering cities and event organizers to plan cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable events through AI simulation and optimization.**

---

## 🌍 Overview

Every year, major cities pledge to reduce waste — yet even flagship events like the Olympics struggle to meet their **zero-waste goals** due to inefficient bin placement, unpredictable crowd movement, and limited visibility into waste behavior.

**CleanFlow** reimagines this challenge with a data-driven approach. Using **AI reasoning and agent-based simulation**, CleanFlow predicts where waste is most likely to occur and recommends **optimal bin placement** that minimizes litter and maximizes recycling efficiency.

Inspired by the upcoming **Los Angeles 2028 Olympics**, this project envisions how AI can help LA become the **first zero-waste Olympic city**.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🔹 Map & Heatmap Upload
- Upload a venue layout and optional foot-traffic heatmap.
- If no data is provided, the AI estimates crowd density using total attendees and vendor locations. (In Development)

### 🔹 Interactive Placement Interface
- Drag-and-drop icons (🗑️ bins, 🏪 vendors, 🚪 entries) directly onto the map.

### 🔹 Smart Variable Controls
Configure real-world parameters:
- Estimated number of people per hour
- Capacity per bin
- Target utilization rate per bin
- Cost per bin  
- Vendor trash output per hour

### 🔹 AI Analysis Output
After clicking **Submit**, the AI:
- Calculates *optimal bin placement*
- Reports *% trash captured* and *# of bins reduced*
- Explains reasoning with data

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Lovable-generated UI (React + Tailwind) with map uploads and overlays |
| **Backend** | Python (Mesa / NumPy) for agent-based waste simulation |
| **Optimization Logic** | Multi-objective heuristic minimizing total bins while maximizing trash capture probability |
| **AI Layer** | LLM for reasoning, visualization narration, and report generation |

## 📊 Example Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | With CleanFlow |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Waste captured | 65% | **95%** |
| Number of bins | 20 | **16 (-20%)** |
| Overflow incidents | 30/day | **0** |
| Recycling rate | 63% | **100%** |
| Cleanup cost | \$2.5 M | **\$2.0 M (-20%)** |

## 🧩 Data Sources

| Data Type | Example Source |
|------------|----------------|
| Waste tonnage & bin data | [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us), [LA Open Data](https://data.lacity.org) |
| Foot-traffic estimates | Google Maps Popular Times, SafeGraph |
| Behavioral coefficients | Keep Britain Tidy (2018), EPA Litter Prevention Study (2021) |
| Venue layouts | OpenStreetMap stadiums, parks, and plazas |
